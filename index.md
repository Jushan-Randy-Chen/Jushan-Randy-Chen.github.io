## About Me
I am actively looking for summer internships in aerospace & defense!

I go by Randy (though my legal name is Jushan). I am currently pursuing my  Ph.D.  in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://ecse.rpi.edu/). I am supervised by [Dr. Santiago Paternain](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~paters/). I do research in the intersection of AI and robotics. In particular, I study efficient and scalable multi-robot decision making and planning by leveraging state-the-the-art generative models, reinforcement learning, optimal control, and dynamic games. Previously, I finished both my B.S. and M.S. in Aerospace Engineering at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/). I was supervised by [Dr. Negar Mehr](https://negarmehr.com/), who is now an assistant professor at UC Berkeley.

I came to the U.S. at the age of 16 and finished high school in Columbia, South Carolina. In my leisure time, I play the piano, play video games, go to the gym, etc. I also like singing; I am a huge fan of Jay Chou (周杰伦，a phenomenal mega star who is the equivalent of Bruno Mars of Asia in terms of his influence). I went to his concert in 2013, when I was 13 years old. 

One of my hobbies is maximizing and redeeming the value of my credit card points & miles to get free hotel nights and free flights back and forth between the U.S. and Asia (it's in fact an optimization problem~). I also have a Youtube channel, and I'm shooting vlogs occasionally for my journeys across the U.S. and Asia.

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning:** safe RL, multi-agent RL
- **SLAM:** deep visual odometry
- **Multi-robot Systems:** distributed trajectory optimization, consensus ADMM
- **Generative AI in robotics:** diffusion models
