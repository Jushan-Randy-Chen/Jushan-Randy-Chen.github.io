## About Me

I go by Randy (though my legal name is Jushan). I am an upcoming Ph.D. student in Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://ecse.rpi.edu/). I am supervised by [Dr. Santiago Paternain](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~paters/). Previously, I finished both my B.S. and M.S. in aerospace engineering at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Negar Mehr](https://negarmehr.com/).

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning:** safe RL, multi-agent RL
- **SLAM:** deep visual odometry
- **Multi-robot Systems:** distributed trajectory optimization, distributed model predictive control, consensus 

## News

- **[May. 2024]** I finished my M.S. in aerospace engineering at UIUC. My thesis titled "Improved pose estimation accuracy of monocular deep visual odometry against dynamic entities via adversarial training" is made publicly available!
- **[Mar. 2024]** I have become a US permanent resident and received my green card!
- **[Jan. 2023]** Our paper titled "Distributed Potential ILQR: Scalable Game-Theoretic Trajectory Planning for
Multi-Agent Interactions" is accepted to ICRA 2023!
- **[May 2022]** I graduated with a B.S. in aerospace engineering (w/ honors) from UIUC!
